Exoskeleton Control GUI Hackathon

Try to complete as many of these tasks as you can. You have two options to 
complete a task:

1) Actually update the Python code from the three provided files
2) Provide a short (<2 minute) explanation of what needs to be done

Hackathon Tasks:

1) Very low difficulty - Make the mocked Arduino code move the actuators 
slower than their current speed of 50 PWM units per second

2) Low difficulty - Make the Connection button text readable and also 
make the button change color depending on the connection state

3) Medium difficulty - Upgrade the GUI code to automatically update the 
Actuator Position values, replacing the current button

4) High difficulty - Upgrade the communication backend to log all GUI and 
Arduino traffic to a log file with the date, time, who made the request, 
who received the request, and what data was involved. Bonus if you can make 
the logs somehow easier to read
