# Exoskeleton Control GUI Hackathon

Try to complete as many of these tasks as you can. You have two options to 
complete a task:

1) Write some code and explain it
2) Write some plain English "pseudocode" and explain it

You are encouraged to only use LLMs as a reference, and not to actually do the
tasks for you.

## Hackathon Tasks:

### 1) Low difficulty
Make the mocked Arduino code move the actuators 
slower than their current speed of 50 PWM units per second

### 2) Medium difficulty
Upgrade the GUI code to automatically update 
the Actuator Position values. Hint: Similar code to what you 
need is used in comm_backend.py

### 3) High difficulty
In the communication backend, implement a system to log all GUI and 
Arduino traffic to a log file with the date, time, who made the request, 
who received the request, and what data was involved. Bonus if you can make 
the logs somehow easier to read
